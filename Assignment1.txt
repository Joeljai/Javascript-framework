Modern web development has evolved significantly with the introduction of powerful JavaScript 
frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js. These frameworks have revolutionized how developers 
build interactive web applications by providing robust component-based architectures and efficient 
state management solutions. Learning these frameworks requires a solid foundation in core 
programming concepts, including HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Additionally, understanding 
version control systems like Git, package managers like npm, and build tools like Webpack has 
become essential for professional web development. The demand for full-stack developers who can 
work with both frontend frameworks and backend technologies like Node.js continues to grow in 
the software industry.
